# Local Service Ads

## Get Qualified Calls Or Don't Pay a Dime!

With Google Local Service Ads (LSA) and our unique service, you can get ENDORSED by Google, show up on top of the search results, and only pay when you get a qualified call!

## Earn the trust of new customers as a Google Endorsed Provider

### Only Pay Per Qualified Call Delivered!

- For Home Service Providers
- For Professional Service Providers
- For Healthcare & Wellbeing Providers

Stop wasting money on PPC! If you qualify for Local Service Ads, you can get calls from qualified potential clients, and only pay when you talk with the lead, and only if they qualify.

Sounds unreal? It's very real and you should start doing it ASAP.

For Home Service providers Google will guarantee your service for up to $2,000 to make sure you get a LOT of interest from customers.

For Professional services providers and Healthcare providers, Google will endorse your company, rank it at the top of search results, and send you quality calls from potential clients.

We listen to all the calls, and if one of them is not qualified, we get you a refund directly from Google.

We're saving our clients 15% of their ad budget that would otherwise be spent on unqualified leads.

It's important to do LSA with professionals, as you can end up being accepted to LSA, but not getting any calls, or getting unqualified calls.

Even if you're in a very competitive market, we get you ample calls.

## Show up on Google Search

In addition to being endorsed by Google, your ads appear at the top of the search results!

- Before PPC (paid ads)
- Before the Map stack
- Before Organic

Local Service Ads show up at the top, and on mobile, they take over more than 50% of the screen when the search results load.

You can't get a better position and exposure on Google than LSA.

## Only pay for results

Control your budget and only pay when a customer gets in touch directly from your ad, so you can focus on real results for your business.

- Pay only for qualified calls from potential clients that want your services in your service area
- We listen to all the calls and dispute any call that is not relevant (usually saving 15% of the budget)
- You get complete control over your budget. Adjust it or pause the service at any time
- The most effective and profitable marketing solution you will ever invest in
