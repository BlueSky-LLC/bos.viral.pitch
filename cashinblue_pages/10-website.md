### New beginning in website functionality

The concept behind A.I. Websites is straightforward: it's all about creating a website experience that directly relates to a visitor's unique situation. This is accomplished by changing the messaging and content of a site based on things like time of day, the number of previous visits to the site, visitor's physical location and more.

A.I. works automatically which leaves you with more time to focus on your business, or maybe even take more time for yourself, imagine that!
