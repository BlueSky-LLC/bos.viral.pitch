## Pricing & FAQ

### Do you also provide Regular SEO Services?

Absolutely! We offer anything and everything that works best for our clients.

### What is the Pay Per Result SEO campaign cost?

Most of our Pay Per Result SEO campaigns range between $650 and $950 per month for the keywords you choose. If you don't rank, you don't need to pay us a single dime.

### What's Local SEO?

Local SEO means ranking your business for the local searches. For example, let's say you run a pest control business in New York. When people in New York search for a pest control business, your website will be the one that appears on the first page. But if someone from California is looking, they won't be seeing you on the first page.

### What's better: SEO or Paid Advertising?

It's complementary. Together, SEO & paid advertising will help you increase your overall reach and reduce your CPC. This will result in reduced customer acquisition costs.

### Do you run national SEO campaigns?

The National SEO campaigns are quote-based.
