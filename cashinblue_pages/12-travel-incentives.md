## Why Opt for Incentive-driven Marketing?

It's no gimmick or sugar-coated game.

It's a WINNING marketing STRATEGY.

Marketing is all about understanding how people's emotions work and playing on them. If you can engage your audience and make them remember you, they WILL come back to you.

An Oxford Economics study indicated that people are 3 times more likely to take action when offered tangible incentives (such as travel) than when offered monetary incentives (like cash discounts).

So when you give your buyers or repeat customers complimentary vacations, you're intensifying their desire to buy and creating a permanent positive brand image.

In fact, we ask you - are you ready to handle the 70% growth in sales, referrals and buyers?

## How can we (or you) giveaway unlimited complimentary vacations?

We work with an industry insider that aggregates room inventory for 5K hotels worldwide. Hotels, in general, are usually not at capacity and always keep a percentage of rooms for us.

The reason being is that they rather have visitors who will buy food, drinks, go to an attraction, casino or gift shop than pay maintenance for empty rooms.

With this program you'll have the power to give anyone you want, clients, friends, and employees, amazing 3-7 nights vacations at 4+ star rated hotels by TripAdvisor.

You're helping yourself attract and retain clients and workers, and helping the hotels in bringing more visitors.
